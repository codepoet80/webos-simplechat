Uses [Sharing Service](https://github.com/webosarchive/sharing-service) which is hosted by [webOSArchive](http://www.webosarchive.org) for the webOS community without guarantee of privacy or performance. Illegal or illicit use strictly prohibited. 

You can also self-host the service, see the [instructions here](https://github.com/webosarchive/sharing-service/blob/main/README.md).
